# Overview

You are in a spaceship and there is a huge field of asteroids coming to destroy your plant! You must destroy all of them to save your world! When you click you launch a bullet to destroy them, but be careful because when you miss, you lose a life! As some of the asteroids are destroyed, they will drop a life to help bring your life count back up. When you hit multiple asteroids at once, you are able to get bonus points. 

I created this game, to learn how to use the arcade library, since I haven't used it in any of my projects before. It had it's own way of thinking and coding, that I had to get used to, and I was able to expand what I am able to do with python. I was able to refamiliarize myself with classes and how to use them in python as well.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the game being played and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

I used visual studio code, with python and the arcade library for python, in addition to the random, math, and time libraries in python. 
I created a couple of my own resources that I added into the resources file for arcade, so if you are looking to use this as an example make sure to download them.

# Future Work

* Add a brief tutorial on opening window
* Saves high score and displays on game over screen
* Levels to add difficulty
